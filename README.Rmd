This is my Stat 547M HW08, continuing where Jenny left off on the package `foofactors`.

The first function added is the `detect_fac` function that detects a list of factors that should be characters when the number of unique levels is equal to the length of the list. When the above scenario happens, `detect_fac()` will convert the list from a list of factors to a list of characters; if there are some levels that appear more than once, then we do nothing to this list.

```{r}
# install_github("MingWan10/foofactors")
library(foofactors)
fbind(iris$Species[c(1, 51, 101)], PlantGrowth$group[c(1, 11, 21)])
freq_out(iris$Species)
detect_fac(factor(c("a", "b", "c")))
```
